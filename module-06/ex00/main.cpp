/*
* Character literals are always within single quotes, e.g., '*'.

* Float literals end in 'f' or 'F' (e.g., "42.0f") and may also use "nanf" or
"inff" for pseudo values.

* Double literals include a decimal point but no 'f' suffix (e.g., "42.0",
"nan", "inf").

* Integer literals have only digits, with no dot, no suffix, and no wrapper
quotes (e.g., "0", "42").

* Pseudo-literals are special floating-point representations (e.g., "nan",
"inf", "nanf", "inff"). */
