Of course! This PDF module is designed to teach you about **polymorphism** in C++, a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming. The exercises build upon each other to introduce different facets of this topic.

Here is a breakdown of the core concept for each exercise.

***

### ## Exercise 00: Polymorphism

This exercise introduces the core concept of **subtype polymorphism** through **virtual functions**.

* [cite_start]**What it teaches:** You'll learn how to make a function in a base class (`Animal`) `virtual`[cite: 92]. [cite_start]This allows you to call that function (`makeSound()`) on a pointer to the base class, but have it execute the specific version of the function from the derived class (`Dog` or `Cat`) that the pointer actually points to[cite: 102, 103]. This is resolved at runtime and is a cornerstone of flexible, object-oriented design.
* [cite_start]**The "WrongAnimal" example** is there to show you what happens if you *don't* use the `virtual` keyword: the base class's function is always called, regardless of the object's actual type[cite: 107, 108].

### ## Exercise 01: I don't want to set the world on fire

This exercise builds on polymorphism to teach about **memory management** within a class hierarchy, specifically the need for a **virtual destructor**.

* [cite_start]**What it teaches:** When you allocate memory for a derived class (`new Dog()`) but store its address in a base class pointer (`Animal*`), you must ensure the derived class's destructor is called when you `delete` the object through that base pointer[cite: 125]. [cite_start]If the base class destructor isn't `virtual`, only the `Animal` destructor will run, leaking the memory allocated for the `Brain` attribute[cite: 119, 121].
* [cite_start]It also reinforces the need for **deep copies** by requiring you to correctly implement the copy constructor and assignment operator to handle the dynamically allocated `Brain`[cite: 127].

### ## Exercise 02: Abstract class

This exercise introduces **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** by using **pure virtual functions**.

* [cite_start]**What it teaches:** Sometimes, creating an instance of a base class doesn't make sense (the PDF notes "Creating Animal objects doesn't make sense... they make no sound!")[cite: 150]. You'll learn to make the `Animal` class abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as a pure virtual function (e.g., `virtual void makeSound() = 0;`). [cite_start]This makes it impossible to create an `Animal` object directly, forcing it to only be used as a base for other concrete classes[cite: 151, 152].

### ## Exercise 03: Interface & recap

This final exercise solidifies these concepts by having you work with **interfaces**, which are implemented in C++ as **pure abstract classes**.

* **What it teaches:** An interface is a class that defines a contract of behaviors (functions) without providing any implementation. [cite_start]In this exercise, `ICharacter` and `IMateriaSource` are interfaces[cite: 186, 212]. Any class that inherits from them *must* implement all of their pure virtual functions. [cite_start]This is a powerful design pattern that decouples your code, allowing you to, for example, have a `Character`'s inventory hold any object that behaves like an `AMateria`, without needing to know if it's `Ice` or `Cure`[cite: 206]. [cite_start]This exercise is a recap that brings together polymorphism, memory management, and abstract classes into a larger design problem[cite: 158].
