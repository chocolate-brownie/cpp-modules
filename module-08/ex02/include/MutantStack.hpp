/*
--- What is std::stack? ---
* It does not support direct iteration.
* It is designed to only access the top element or remove it.
* Behind the scenes, it uses a container like deque, but you can specify your
own container if needed, e.g.:

std::stack<int, std::vector<int>> customStack;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- What does std::deque do? ---
* It provides efficient insertion and removal at both front (push_front(),
pop_front()) and back (push_back(), pop_back()).
* During its operation, std::deque stores elements in multiple blocks, unlike
std::vector which stores elements contiguouslyâ€”this makes growth at either end
faster in many cases.

std::deque is suitable in scenarios where you need efficient insertion/deletion
at both ends.
